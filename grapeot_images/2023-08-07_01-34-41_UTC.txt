The close up view - experiments of using a telescope to record air show at home. To my surprise, I've recently discovered that the best equipment for recording an air show might actually be a telescope and a cinema camera. This is due to the fact that the majority of our investment in high-end, hefty long lenses is typically for their lightweight, bokeh, and autofocus features. However, these features are not useful for an air show, as the planes are usually quite distant and we don't need to use autofocus, but can instead rely on a hyperfocal distance.

Furthermore, most cameras, even those designed for sports, can only perform full-resolution RAW continuous shooting at a maximum of 20fps for a few seconds, not to mention those cameras are usually only 6k. In contrast, a cinema camera can record 8k RAW files at 120fps at full resolution indefinitely, provided the battery and card can keep up.

Therefore, it's much simpler to shoot hundreds of thousands of frames and then select the best ones during video post-processing, rather than painstakingly calculating the camera's remaining buffer. Additionally, the image quality may be superior, given that cinema cameras typically have a higher dynamic range and larger sensor (VistaVision compared to full frame).
