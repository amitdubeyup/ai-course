An effective way to achieve large magnification on a small telescope is eyepiece projection. For example, for this 350mm FL, f/2.8 telescope, if we want to use traditional Barlow lenses to achieve 6800mm FL so the moon could fill a 6x6 film, it would require 20x magnification. And that would destroy the image quality, not to mention the imaging circle would also be very limited. But with eyepiece projection, one can do this with ease. Projection a bright moon onto a 6x6 region, or even use Instax film to get a instant photo.
