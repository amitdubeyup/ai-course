The nature of monochrome photography of a Leica M11 Monochrom makes it a fascinating tool for infrared photography. Regular color cameras tend to produce a strong red cast with an infarred filter, and the blue and green CFA filters cause those pixels to have almost zero efficiency for infrared signals. So I recently started experimenting with infrared photography using M11 Monochrome.

I discovered an interesting filter that can have a variable passing bandwidth. Similar to a variable ND filter, it consists of two stacked filters, and when you rotate the top one, you can adjust the bandpass wavelength from 550 nm to 750 nm. This allows it to function from a dark red filter to an aggressive infrared filter.

The filter performs well when the passing wavelength isn't near the upper limit. However, when it approaches 740 to 750 nm, some strange reflections can cause uneven exposure across the frame. Despite this, this is a particularly interesting filter because, with a dark red filter, green leaves appear dark, but in infrared, they are quite bright. This variable filter offers an effective way to adjust the relative contrast between different objects. The example photos demonstrate how the scene changes with different bandpass wavelengths using this specific filter.
