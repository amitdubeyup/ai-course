Even with the gears mentioned in the previous post, using a camera for astrophotography still presents many technical challenges. One significant obstacle is achieving precise and efficient focus at night, which is often overlooked by astrophotography newcomers. A star may appear sharp in the live view at 100% magnification, but that doesn't guarantee it will remain pinpoint small after a 30-second exposure.

Thankfully, there's a piece of equipment called a Bahtinov mask that can help with this issue. It resembles a lens hood, as shown in the first figure, and cleverly uses diffraction to help identify the in-focus position. The second figure displays a sample image with the Bahtinov mask in front of the lens and in focus, while the third figure shows an out-of-focus image. The goal is to make the three bars evenly spaced, which allows for precise focusing.

With proper focus, monochrome cameras can provide impressive efficiency in astrophotography. The fourth figure shows an example of an M11 monochrom camera capturing the M101 the Pinwheel Galaxy with a telescope. Itâ€™s a single frame with 5 minute exposure. By using the Leica Fotos app, we can remotely download the DNG file and use Lightroom to examine the galaxy's shape right away. We can even clearly see the super nova recently appeared in the galaxy! More photos can be further combined to get a clean, noise free image later.
