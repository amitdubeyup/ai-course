Compared to regular color digital cameras, monochrome cameras have three major advantages in astrophotography. First, due to the absence of the de-mosaic process, monochrome cameras can produce higher resolution images, allowing for more potential in post-processing. 

Second, monochrome cameras can capture a new channel, luminance. In color cameras, each pixel can only store one of the three (RGB) channels due to the presence of Bayer filters. However, monochrome cameras can collect photons from all the RGB channels, making them three times more efficient than color cameras, which is a significant advantage.

Third, even without considering the luminosity channel, monochrome cameras can still capture color information more flexibly. Virtually no nebulae or galaxies are green, meaning the green channel is the most inefficient due to its minimal presence. Regular Bayer filters have half of the channels assigned to green, which is suitable for regular photography but not ideal for astrophotography. Monochrome cameras with dedicated color filters can distribute exposure time more flexibly across different channels. For example, they can allocate exposure time to R, G, and B channels in a 2:1:2 ratio, spending less time on the least important channels.

Monochrome cameras have more capabilities, but they also require additional equipment to function properly. The photo demonstrates a typical setup for astrophotography using monochrome cameras (#leica #m11monochrom here). The red arrow indicates the filter drawer, which holds filters such as luminosity, red, green, or blue. These filters can be easily swapped during the photography process. 

Another essential component is the guider, which assists the equatorial mount during tracking. An optical component (Off Axis Guider) splits the light from the main telescope and delivers it to an extra camera taking short exposures. By comparing adjacent frames, the camera identifies any minor movements of the target star during the shooting process. This is crucial for long exposures and long focal lengths. With the aid of the guider, modern mounts can achieve exposures of up to half an hour and focal lengths of around 1000mm.
