I was working on shooting one photo in the past 1+ year. This month I finally got a powerful server set up and had time to code by myself to process the accumulated 600+ hours exposure and got this 30 billion pixel photo: https://yage.ai/dss/. It’s a panorama of our night sky in the hydrogen alpha wavelength. Currently it covers about 2/3 of the entire sky, and because we cannot see anything below the horizon, I’m also sending six telescopes + cameras to Chile to take the southern half. It might be entertaining to check out the photo. If you are curious about what you see in the view, click the “toggle annotation” button to see what it is. There is also a smaller color version of the panorama: https://yage.ai/dss/spring/
