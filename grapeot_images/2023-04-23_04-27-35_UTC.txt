After the birth of my kiddo, my motivation for photography immediately shifted from creating art to capturing memories. I hadn't bought any new gear for a while, but the M11 Monochrome recently reignited my passion for photography. It's a luxury for a middle-aged man to have a passion for anything these days. ðŸ˜‚

Upon further research, I discovered that the M11 Monochrome is quite different from, say, an M6 with black and white film. It's not just about resolution; it's also about ISO. Monochrome photography requires lines, patterns, and textures, which is why super wide-angle lenses can be useful for monochrome. They can easily stretch nearby lines to create an aesthetic appeal.

However, most super wide-angle lenses offered by Leica are too bulky, like the WATE or the 18mm f/3.8. They're better than competitors, but they still negate the lightweight and compact nature of an M body. There are third-party M-mount pancake super wide-angle lenses available, such as MS Optics, but their usable apertures are usually f/8 or even f/16 due to their minimal lens elements. This makes them unsuitable for regular cameras, but perfect for M Monochromes.

If you examine sample photos, you'll find that the 200,000 ISO from the M11 Monochrome is very similar to 400 ISO black and white film, or even 200 ISO for some brands. This makes the M11M and pancake super wide-angle lenses a perfect match. After figuring this out, I immediately signed up for an M11M and also bought an MS Optics pancake lens. It looks great on the M6, but it's probably not very useful for anything other than outdoor sunny day shooting. However, it has already given me more motivation to take photos!
